# Subtitle Burner

Ever wanted to Chromecast with subtitles, but most players like VLC simply do not support subtitles?

This utility makes it easy to burn subtitles inside `.mkv` files onto the video data itself
so that subtitles can be seen regardless of which player you are using.

## Installation

Packages will be provided later.

# Subtitle Burner

Ever wanted to Chromecast with subtitles, but most players like VLC simply do not support subtitles?

This utility makes it easy to burn subtitles inside `.mkv` files onto the video data itself
so that subtitles can be seen regardless of which player you are using.

## Installation

Packages will be provided later.

### Arch

Local builds can be installed:

```
npm run build
npm run package
sudo pacman -U ./dist/subtitle-burner-1.01.pacman
```
